  <h2 class="title">
    HOMER AND THE STUDY OF GREEK
  </h2>


<p style="text-align: justify;">In an article entitled "<i>A Year — or more — of Greek</i>," contributed
to the February, 1918, number of the <i>Classical Journal</i>,
the author sets forth a few of the more important reasons why
the present system of teaching beginners in Greek should be
revised to meet modern conditions. The sum and substance of
the article was a plea for the abandonment of Xenophon for beginning
work, something which should have been done years ago,
and the substitution of Homer in his place. The paper embodied
the results of several years of experimentation; and the primary
reason urged for the change was based on the comparative literary
value of the two authors and their appeal to beginning students.
As we view the situation to-day, we are compelled to confess that
in the hands of the average teacher, when applied to the average
student, Xenophon and all his works are all too often found to be
tedious and dreary. This leaves out of count the exceptional
teacher, who has large and enthusiastic classes in the Anabasis
year after year, for such teachers could make any subject fascinating.
Homer on the other hand possesses those qualities which
make him especially interesting, as well as of permanent value, to
the majority of students who still take Greek.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In this connection the author may be permitted to quote
  from the article just mentioned: "The reasons which make Homer
so desirable are apparent when once the question is seriously
considered. His work is homogeneous in vocabulary, in literary
style and idioms employed, and in metrical form; so that when
students once get a fair start in him, further progress becomes
easier and more accelerated. He employs all three persons, with
all modes and tenses of the verb, so that all forms that are learned

are used enough to be kept fresh in the students' mind and do not
have to be learned again when they begin anything which is in
dialogue form. His vocabulary is fairly limited, enough so in
fact that it does not present any special difficulty to the beginner.
His sentences are short, simple, and clear-cut, having none of the
involved structure which makes so much of Xenophon really too
difficult for first-year work. The verse, which has been considered
a bar, is an actual help, as it is quite easily learned and is a marked
aid in memorizing considerable portions of Greek, which is important
at this stage. Furthermore, the rules of quantity are a
considerable help in simplifying and illustrating the principles of
accent. As he uses only one type of verse, and that the simplest
 — the dactylic hexameter — the ordinary student usually becomes
quite adept at reading this before the end of the first year's work.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"The prose composition for the first year's work may be based
upon Homer, the students using Homeric forms and constructions,
without knowing of the existence of any other kind. This may be
done without the slightest fear of blunting their sense of discrimination
between poetic and prose diction and style, a sense
which cannot possibly be developed until they have had several
years' work and have read a considerable amount of Greek in both
prose and poetry. Homer is so straightforward and simple in
what he has to say, with nothing obscure, mystical, or far-fetched
in any way, that he is quite intelligible to the average high-school
freshman; and at the same time he possesses the qualities of high
literary art in such a marked degree that he appeals strongly to
the oldest and most advanced members of any college class.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"Furthermore, Homer is the best possible preparation for all
later Greek literature, much of which is unintelligible without
a fair knowledge of him. He was to Greek literature what the
Bible has been to English, and a great deal more as well. He leads
us somewhere, not merely into a blind alley as does Xenophon,
both with reference to later Greek literature and to much of the
best in later European literature as well, where his influence has
been incalculable and perhaps greater than that of any other
single writer. In him are the germs of so many things. We have


the narrative highly developed, the beginning of the drama,
oratory, statecraft, seamanship, war, adventure, and religion -
in fact, life as it was to the old Greeks in its manifold aspects.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"Then the student who has taken only a very little of beginning
Greek, even if he has progressed no farther than the end of the
first book of the Iliad, has come into vital contact with the magic
and the music of the Greek language, used in one of the most
beautiful, one of the most varied, and one of the most influential
literary compositions of all ages; and though he may have devoted
considerable labor to mining the gold, he cannot, truthfully say,
and probably will not want to say, that Greek for him has been a
waste of time."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">To begin the study of Greek with Homer, it would be necessary
to substitute Homeric for Attic Greek for the work of the first year:
the student would be taught Homeric forms and constructions as a
basis for future work, and would devote to the study of Homer
the time which is now occupied by Xenophon. It is the purpose
of the present paper to develop more in detail some of the most
important reasons which make such a change not only desirable
but imperative if Greek is to be saved as a vital factor in our educational
system.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea of such a plan first suggested itself to the writer several
years ago, when, full of boundless enthusiasm ??? his subject
and for all things Greek, he was attempting to teach first-year
work and Xenophon, and was compelled to admit to himself that
his efforts were not meeting noth what might be called success.
Too many good students refused to take Greek in the first place,
and of those who did enlist, too many, even of the better ones, were
discouraged by the unending round of grammatical forms, leading
up to an author whose works are not of a nature to fire the imagination
and stir the hearts in the breasts of our youth, as can be,
and is, done by the great masterpieces of Hellas such as the <i>Iliad</i>
and the <i>Odyssey</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The writer would like to make it plain that he is not a hater of
Xenophon, but that he greatly enjoyed his first year of Greek,
taken in the old way, as well as his Xenophon, later. The same

is probably true of most classical scholars. This goes a long way
toward explaining why they are now teaching Greek and Latin
instead of sociology or mechanical engineering. It would be distinctly
misleading however for those who have a special taste
for linguistic work and who enjoyed reading the production of
such authors as Caesar and Xenophon to infer therefrom that
their case is at all typical of the mass of students who take these
subjects. Although the description in Andrew Lang's essay,
"Homer and the Study of Greek," is probably too highly colored,
the account that he gives of his own experience and that of his
fellows in the study of beginning Greek and Xenophon ought to
have a lesson and a warning for every one who is still a friend of
the classics. He makes it quite plain that they found Xenophon
anything but inspiring, and that most of them thoroughly hated
him, an experience of many good students, which is too common
to be ignored.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is only fair to state that although this idea of beginning Greek
with the reading of Homer is original with the writer, it is not
new. This was the regular method employed by the old Romans
in teaching their boys Greek, and it was highly commended by
that capable and judicious old schoolmaster, Quintilian, as the
best possible plan. Since that time it has been used now and then
by some of the world's ablest educators and scholars. It was thus
that Joseph Scaliger (de la Scala), one of the most brilliant
names in the whole history of classical scholarship, taught himself
Greek at Paris; and many more of the great scholars of the past
learned their Greek through Homer. It was tried also by Herbart,
who began a series of experiments in Switzerland, in 1797, where he
employed this method with marked success in private tutoring.
Later he continued his experiments on a larger scale in the teachers'
training college at Koenigsberg, with such good results that he
was thoroughly convinced that this was the only suitable method
of teaching beginning Greek. At his suggestion it was tried by
Dissen, by Ferdinand Ranke, and by Hummel, all of whom were
hearty in its praise; and, most important of all, by Ahrens, at
Hanover, where it was used for thirty years (1850-1881), with

great success, but was finally abandoned because of the lack of
suitable text books and because of the opposition of other Gymnasia
which refused to adopt such a revolutionary plan. It has also
been recommended occasionally, but without success, by other
scholars and humanists, notably by Goethe, by Andrew Lang,
and by Wilamowitz, in Europe; while in America it has been
advocated in one form or another by Seymour, Bolling, Shorey,
Lane Cooper, and others. But hitherto no systematic series of
text books has been issued which are so well adapted to carry the
students through Homer and introduce them to Attic Greek as the
ones which have been worked out in connection with Xenophon.
It has become highly important that this lack be supplied, if possible,
in order that this plan, which has been tried by several
with such good success, may be tested on a wider scale, so that we
may see whether or no it will succeed in the hands of the average
teacher of beginning Greek. Thus students should be prepared
to strike immediately into the heart of Greek literature, instead
of having to go a long way around, as at present.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">As to the superiority of Homer over Xenophon, from the standpoint
of literary values, and of interest for the average student,
there can be no quarrel. It remains for us to investigate the
relative advantages and demerits of each as mediums for teaching
the language.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the first place it is essential that we disabuse our minds of the
once prevalent notion, long since exploded, but still more or less
consciously held by many, that the Attic dialect is the norm by
which all other Greek is to be judged. The language of Homer is
earlier and naturally differs from it in many essentials; therefore
it was long maintained that Homeric Greek is irregular, crude and
unfinished. Hellenistic Greek, which represents a later development
of the language, has its differences; therefore Hellenistic
Greek must be degenerate. Such an idea is utterly unscientific
and ignores completely the modern historical point of view of the
development and growth of languages. Any period which has
given birth to literary productions of surpassing merit and artistic
excellence is justified by its own works; it contains its own linguistic standards, and will richly repay those who take the trouble
to study it. To call Homeric Greek anomalous and irregular,
because it differs in some particulars from the Attic dialect, is as
misleading as it would be to say that the language of Shakespeare
is immature and eccentric because he does not write the same type
of English as does George Ade or Stephen Leacock. As a matter
of fact, the language of the Homeric poems is quite as finished, has
quite as many virtues, and is quite as much of a norm for its
period and style of composition as Xenophon is for his; and the
different forms in Homer are no more aberrations on his part than
those of Xenophon are marks of degeneracy for him. And Attic
Greek, after all, is but one of a number of dialects, coming at neither
end but in the middle of the development of the Greek language.
It is rarely found pure in any of the great authors, and in none
which are suitable for beginners.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">According to our present system, students are taught a smattering
of Attic Greek. Then they are given a smattering of Homer,
who represents a period several centuries earlier. Then again
comes some more Attic Greek, and if the student continues in his
work he usually gets some Doric, with sometimes a little Lesbian,
and the Ionic of Herodotus, to which is commonly added a dash
of the Koine for further confusing variety. All of this comes at
such times and at such points in his development that it is practically
impossible for the ordinary student to obtain a clear conception
of what the Greek language is like and what are the fundamental
processes of its development. As a result grammar becomes
a nightmare to be dreaded instead of an opportunity to study the
structure of one of the most interesting and instructive languages
in existence. This has reference to the linguistic features, apart
from its literary value. If on the other hand we begin with Homer
and obtain a good grounding in his language, the transition from
that to later Greek is simple and natural and in accordance with
well-established laws, so that a student who once gets a grasp
of the processes involved not only has acquired a valuable scientific
point of view, but he might be untrue enough to the traditions of
countless students of the past to find Greek grammar interesting.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, since most of us learned our Attic Greek first,
when we came to Homeric Greek and found so many different
forms, the feeling very naturally arose with many that Homer has
many more forms than Attic Greek, and that they are more difficult.
On the contrary, the Homeric forms are not only simpler and more
transparent than the Attic and as a consequence more easily
learned — many Attic forms have to be explained by a reference
to the Homeric ones — but the Homeric forms are considerably
fewer in number. This is best seen by a reference to the declensional
endings, as exemplified in the two tables, 479, 649.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From these tables we see that there are, all told, 86 Homeric
forms of the noun and adjective to be learned as against 108 Attic
forms. But this is not all. Many forms in both Attic and
Homeric Greek are so rare that it would be manifestly absurd to
compel first-year students to memorize them. For our purposes,
then, we must omit the unusually rare forms from both tables.
In the first table (479) we shall omit a number of forms which
many would include, and count only those not inclosed in brackets
which are regularly included as essential by the standard beginners'
books based on the Attic dialect. We shall not count the very
rare Homeric forms, but shall be liberal enough to include a few
which are too rare to be learned in reading Homer but are important
for students intending to read Attic Greek later. We
find then that students who begin with Homeric Greek need to
learn only 55 forms as against 80 (88 according to some) of
the Attic. This means that it is necessary to memorize about
fifty per cent more forms in order to be able to read the first
four books of the <i>Anabasis</i> than it would be to read the first
six books of the <i>Iliad</i>. Furthermore, in the pronouns, by not
compelling the student to memorize any form which does not
occur on an average of at least once every two or three thousand
verses, there would be fewer Homeric forms to be learned here
also. The same is true of the verbs. The reflexive pronoun, for
example, and the future passive and future optative of verbs are
not found in Homer; the middle voice regularly retains the uncontracted
forms of the endingS and not in a part only as in Attic Greek;
and in many other ways the forms are simpler and more
easily learned. In fact many books for beginners find it easier to
teach Attic Greek by a constant reference to the earlier forms,
which in many cases are the Homeric.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The occasional irregular forms, which are omitted from the
ones to be learned, should be grouped in some convenient way for
reference, but need not be memorized, as they are regularly given
in their alphabetical place in the vocabulary of any good school
edition and in the ordinary lexicons. Thus the student need
not be required to memorize the five forms of the present infinitive
of <span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_εἰμί_(etapa).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>εἰμί</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>, or the five forms of the genitive of <span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_ἐγώ_(Kawdek).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἐγώ</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>, e.g., but could
learn one of each and not burden his memory with forms which
are found in every vocabulary.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Many Atticists have maintained that the great number of
irregularities in Homeric Greek would be an added difficulty to the
beginner. It is true that they are troublesome, but not so troublesome
as the considerably greater number of irregularities in Attic
Greek. Any one who will take the trouble to count them will
find that the irregular formations in Attic Greek considerably
outnumber those in Homer. There is not space here to catalogue
the various irregularities, heteroclites, metaplastic forms, etc., of
Attic Greek, but the lists given in Kuehner-Blass, or any other of
the more elaborate Greek grammars, are enough to convince the
most skeptical.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">If we leave aside the irregularities and look at a few regular
formations which must be memorized, the evidence is none the less
conclusive. For example, the "regular" declensions of such words
as
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_πόλις_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>πόλις</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_βασιλεύς_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>βασιλεύς</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
<span><b>ναῦς</b></span>,
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_πῆχυς_(Kawdek).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>πῆχυς</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_ἄστυ_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἄστυ</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
comparatives in
<span><b>-ιων</b></span>,
and other
forms which will readily occur to any one who has studied Attic
Greek, are so complicated that they are not ordinarily mastered by
students of beginning Greek, and it would be rather remarkable
if they were. Or let us consider a single class, such as typical
words of the third declension in <span><b>υς</b></span>,
as
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_πῆχυς_(Kawdek).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>πῆχυς</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
<span><b>δίπηχυς</b></span>,
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_ἡδύς_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἡδύς</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
<span><b>ἔγχελυς</b></span>,
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_ἰχθύς_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἰχθύς</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>.
If the student learned the declension of any one of these,
and attempted to decline the rest accordingly, he would go far
astray; for of these five words, all of the third declension, and all

ending in vs in the nominative, no two are declined alike
throughout. A comparison of the declensions of <span><b>ἔγχελυς</b></span> (eel) with
that of <span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_ἰχθύς_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἰχθύς</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span> (fish) will illustrate the point. It seems that the old
Athenians were never able to decide definitely whether an eel
was a fish or a serpent. Accordingly, we find that they declined
<span><b>ἔγχελυς</b></span> the first half of the way like <span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_ἰχθύς_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἰχθύς</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>, while the other
half was different. What a pity that there are not a few more
such convenient mnemonic devices to help the student keep his
bearings on his way through the maze of Greek morphology!
If a student finally learned to decline such a word as <span><b>ναῦς</b></span>, he would
not know how to begin the declension of another word formed in
the same way, such as <span><b>γραῦς</b></span>; nor would a student who had
learned the declension of <span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_βοῦς_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>βοῦς</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span> in Attic Greek know the declension
of the next word like it, <span><b>χοῦς</b></span>,
and he might be led
very far astray by such a simple and common word as
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_νοῦς_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>νοῦς</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>.
All of these forms, and many more which could be cited, are highly
interesting to philologists, as they illustrate so beautifully certain
abstruse principles in Greek phonology and morphology. Unfortunately
they do not usually have the same strong appeal to
the beginner who is trying very hard to learn how to read
Greek.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The whole system of contraction, which is regular at times, and
the variations caused by it in the general rules- of accent and
quantity, all of which are so confusing and so difficult to the
ordinary beginner, are so little used in Homer that they can very
profitably be omitted, or else touched quite lightly, and the time
saved can be invested elsewhere to much greater advantage.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In the field of syntax Homer is so much simpler than Xenophon
that students ordinarily find him a great deal easier. Tlius
Homer lacks the articular infinitive; long and involved passages
in indirect discourse never occur, as well as many other strange
and foreign characteristics of Attic Greek and Xenophon, all of
which give a great deal of trouble to the ordinary beginner.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">These elements all contribute to a quicker and an easier learning
of Greek through Homer, as has been abundantly proved by experiments
also. Thus students who begin with Homer regularly read

more Greek in the time devoted to him than do those who begin
with Xenophon and spend this time on the <i>Anabasis</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It has long been a commonly accepted myth that Homer has
such an enormous vocabulary that students would have more
than ordinary trouble with it. In fact the vocabulary of the first
six books of the <i>Iliad</i> is no larger than that required for reading the
<i>Anabasis</i>, and one can read the whole of the Homeric poems, including
the hymns, without having to learn many more words
than to read Xenophon, and without having to learn so many
words as are necessary for the reading of Plato.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">There are, it is true, a great number of words in Homer which are
used only once (<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_ἅπαξ_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἅπαξ</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_λεγόμενα_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>λεγόμενα</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>)
The <i>Iliad</i> has 1097 of these,
while the <i>Odyssey</i> has 868, making a total of 1965. However,
this is not nearly so large as the number used by Xenophon, who
has 3021 <span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_ἅπαξ_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἅπαξ</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_λεγόμενα_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>λεγόμενα</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>, of which 433 are in the <i>Anabasis</i>, as compared
with 266 (238 if we omit the <i>Catalogue of Ships</i>) in the first
six books of the <i>Iliad</i>.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is highly important too in gaining a vocabulary to learn words
which will be used in other authors read later in the course, and to
acquire so far as possible the more fundamental meanings of words
from which their later uses are derived. Ahrens, who made a
careful study of this problem, gives the palm to Homer here without
question. According to' him, the words in Homer are much
nearer their fundamental meanings, and take on different shades of
significance in the various later authors. If one wishes to obtain
a clear grasp of Greek onomatology and semasiology, he should
begin with Homer by all means and would thus be prepared to
see more readily the later turns in the meanings of words and
phrases, which in many cases vary considerably in authors of the
same period, and sometimes even in the same author. Thus there
are over 400 words in the Anabasis which either do not occur
at all in Xenophon's other works, or else with a different signification.
Rutherford (<i>The New Phryn</i>., 160 if.) says: "It did not escape the notice of later Greeks that Xenophon's diction was very
different from that of pure Attic writers, and there are still extant
several remarks upon this point. ... A busy man, living almost
wholly abroad, devoted to country pursuits and the life of the
camp, attached to the Lacedaemonian system of government, and
detesting the Athenian, Xenophon must have lost much of the
refined Atticism with which he was conversant in his youth. It is
not only in the forms of words that he differs from Attic writers,
but he also uses many terms — the <span><b>ὀνόματα γλωσσηματικά</b></span> of
Galen — altogether unknown to Attic prose, and often assigns to
Attic words a meaning not actually attached to them in the
leading dialect."</p>

Homer which enter into the vocabulary of other Greek writers,

important authors read in college.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">The vocabularies of Xenophon and Homer, which are compared
in these lists, are: Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i> entire, and Homer's
<i>Iliad</i>, books I-VI. The pages as given above are according to
the Teubner texts. The number of words in Xenophon's <i>Anabasis</i>
is approximately the same as that of Homer's <i>Iliad</i>, books I-VI.

In these lists, words which are closely enough related to others
that ordinary students who know the meaning of one may infer
the other are counted but once, as
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_θάνατος_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>θάνατος</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_ἀθάνατος_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>ἀθάνατος</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
<span data-audio-file="Forvo/Pharr_βαίνω_(peri22b).mp3" onclick="playclip(this)"><b>βαίνω</b></span><span><img class="inlineicon" src="../Images/volume-icon.png"/></span>,
<span><b>ἐκβαίνω</b></span>,

etc. Proper names are also omitted.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">From this table it will be seen that Homer is a much better
preparation for the Greek drama, Hesiod, the elegiac and iambic
poets, than is Xenophon, and it is along these lines that the course
should be developed. For Plato the difference is so exceedingly
slight that in the matter of vocabulary one is practically as good a
preparation as the other, and a few of his easier dialogues should
find a place after some of the best poetry has been read. After
that the Greek course ought to be able to take care of itself. Herodotus
might come at any point. There is a slight advantage here
on the side of Xenophon in the matter of vocabulary, but his
language is so much closer to that of Homer, as well as his general
style and imaginative genius, that he would be very easy and
stimulating to those who had read any considerable amount of
Homeric Greek. Those who wished to read Thucydides and the
orators would find Xenophon's vocabulary somewhat better for
their purpose, and the same is true if they wished to read the
New Testament and Menander; but in all these the advantage
is relatively slight, and in most cases the difference would probably
not be noticeable. In the case of the New Testament, for example,
the difference is less than one word in two Teubner pages of Greek
text.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">It is generally recognized that for the best results in the study
of the New Testament, students should read a considerable amount
of other Greek first. In the whole circle of Greek literature the
two authors most important for the student of the New Testament
are Homer and Plato. Herodotus informs us that Homer and
Hesiod were the chief sources of the Greek popular religion; and


certainly one cannot obtain a clear grasp of the forces opposed to
Christianity without a good knowledge of Homer and of the hold
that Homer had upon the popular mind. If one is to read intelligently
the works of the early church fathers, he must be well
acquainted at first hand with Homer. It is Homer, Homer's
religion, and Homer's gods which recur constantly in their works
and which are attacked over and over again as being the bulwarks of
the heathen faith which they are striving to supplant. Homer and
the ideas he represents are infinitely more important for the student
of the New Testament and of the early church than is Xenophon;
and if one can study not more than a year or so of Greek before
taking up the New Testament, he should by all means have some
Homer followed by Plato. Experience has shown that after a
year of Homer, students can and do pass with little difficulty
into the New Testament. The passage from Homer to Attic, or
to Hellenistic, Greek is of course a great deal easier than <i>vice versa</i>,
and occupies very little time and effort.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some have urged that since the bulk of the work in the ordinary
college course in Greek is in the Attic dialect, students who begin
with this would get a firmer grasp of it than if they began with
Homer. Some even feel that a student who did his beginning
work in Homeric forms would never be able to feel thoroughly at
home in Attic Greek. Yet few teachers would be rash enough to
suggest that because a student has had a thorough training in
Attic Greek he is thereby disqualified from doing first-class work
in the language of the Hellenistic period, nor would many teachers
of New Testament Greek, e.g., object to a student who wished
to specialize in their subject, or even in Patristic Greek, if he came
to them with a good knowledge of Plato. Students who wish to
specialize in Pliny and Tacitus, or even in Mediaeval Latin, do
not find themselves handicapped because they did their earlier
work in such authors as Caesar, Cicero, Vergil, Horace, and
Catullus. Teachers of the Romance languages also universally
recognize that a thorough course in Latin is a prerequisite for the
highest type of scholarship in their field, and no student could
hope to do advanced linguistic work in any of these languages


without a thorough training in Latin. In the same way Homer
offers an unexcelled preparation not only for all later Greek literature
but for the later language as well; and instead of the present
system of confusion in the teaching of Greek grammar, particularly
with reference to the various dialects, some attempt should be
made to develop the subject in a more scientific fashion.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Some feel that Homer is too beautiful and too exquisite to be
used as a <i>corpus vile</i> for the teaching of Greek grammar. But
the very fact that he is so beautiful and so exquisite is the very
reason why he should be used at this early stage, that the students
may have an added incentive for learning their grammar, and may
not come to hate and despise the whole subject. Thus they may
see, even from the beginning, that Greek is something worth
working at, and they may have material interesting enough that
the necessary grammatical drill will not seem so much useless
drudgery.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">A highly important consideration in placing Homer before Xenophon
in the curriculum is the fact that as matters now stand such a
large per cent of our students never reach Homer. The problem
before us with regard to these students is whether we are to give
them Xenophon or Homer. Since they represent a very large
element, not all of whom are loafers either, we owe it to ourselves
and to the cause of Greek, as well as to them, to give them that
which will be of most lasting value to them.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Furthermore, Homer is interesting not only to older students, but
is particularly adapted to the youngest who now take Greek, as
the earliest experiments, made with boys from nine to fourteen
years of age, have amply demonstrated. He serves the double
purpose of introducing them adequately to the language and of
furnishing them with reading material as interesting as can be
found in any literature, something too of permanent value; and
he should come by all means as early as possible in the course, that
he may serve as a suitable basis for the development of those
qualities of taste and appreciation, without which the study of
all art is in vain. And after we have begun with him, we find his
treasures inexhaustible. In Herbart's expressive phrase, "Homer


elevates the student without depressing the teacher." To quote
further from his lectures on education, he says (VI, 283) : "The
reasons for giving the preference to Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> in early instruction
are well known. Any one who reads the <i>Odyssey</i> carefully,
with an eye to the various main classes of interest which are
to be aroused by education, can discover the reasons. The point,
however, to be gained here is not merely to produce a direct effect,
but beyond that to get points of connection for progressive instruction.
There can be no better preparation for ancient history
than gaining interest for ancient Greece by the Homeric stories.
The ground is prepared for both the cultivation of taste and the
study of languages at the same time.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"Philologists will be obliged sooner or later to listen to reasons
of this kind, which are actually derived from the chief aim of all
instruction, and are only opposed by tradition (the conventional
study of Latin). This they must do, unless they desire that now,
with the growth of history and science, and the pressure of material
interests, Greek should be restricted in schools as Hebrew is at
present.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">"The <i>Odyssey</i>, it is true, possesses no magic power to animate
those who are entirely unsuccessful in languages, or who do not
work at them seriously; nevertheless it surpasses in definite educative
influence, as is proved by the experience of many years,
every other work of classic times that could be chosen."</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">In conclusion the writer would earnestly suggest that it is high
time that Xenophon be omitted completely from at least the first
three years of Greek study. The time and labor now devoted to
both Xenophon and Homer should be spent on Homer alone, and
for the three books of the <i>Iliad</i> and the four books of the <i>Anabasis</i>
usually read should be substituted a course in Homer which would
be extensive enough to give the students a real insight into his
poetry, that they may learn to wander for themselves in the realms
of gold, that they may be allowed to become so familiar with his language
and his style that reading from him will be a pleasure and
not a lot of hard work to be waded through, that they may become
so filled with his spirit that they may catch a glimpse of what it


means to be Homeric, and in later years, if they have gone out
into other fields and would like to turn back to Greek literature,
it would be a comparatively simple matter for them to bring out
their old book and enter again with delight into his world of song.
In the secondary schools we should have a course in Homer comprehensive
enough to enable the students to obtain a firm grounding
in his language and ideas, instead of the present smattering
of both Xenophon and Homer, neither of which the average student
knows well enough for it to serve as a stable and satisfactory basis
for future work. It would be a real step forward on the part of
the colleges, and should largely increase the number of those now
offering Greek for admission, if the requirements in Greek should
be made a requirement in Homer only, due attention being paid to
composition and grammar, of course. Thus the secondary schools
could intensify their efforts on one dialect and on one homogeneous
mass of literature, which would materially simplify their problems,
and ought to produce a much higher grade of work than is possible
at present. If colleges would admit students on one, two, and three
years, respectively, of Homer, with due credit for each, and reserve
all work in the Attic dialect for the college course proper,
the secondary teachers would have their burdens greatly lightened,
with a corresponding increase in effectiveness. In no other language
do the secondary schools undertake to prepare a student
in two separate dialects. To do so in Greek is a pedagogical
blunder which should be perpetuated no longer.</p>
