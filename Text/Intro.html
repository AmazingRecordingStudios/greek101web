				<p style="text-align: justify;">There is a shortage of resources for beginners in the study of Greek, and expecially audio resources to hear it spoken, for those that study it by themselves. This project aims to fill that void, by creating an open platform in which <strong>everyone is encouraged to contribute</strong> by recording themselves while reading Greek and <strong>sending us the audio files</strong> to include them in the website, app and ebook (<a href="/Text/Contacts.html">write us</a> at <em>amazingrecordingstudios {at} gmail {dot} com</em> ).</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify;">The idea is that starting to learn Greek from real quotes (like epic and poetic ones from the Iliad and the Odyssey) is more engaging and meaninful than with the usual plain and made up phrases used in typical grammar textbooks. And spoken words tend to imprint themselves into memory, even before one can understand and transcribe them.</p>

				<p style="text-align: justify;">The current recordings are taken from a <a href="https://librivox.org/the-odyssey-book-6-by-homer/">librivox recording of the Odyssey Book 6</a>, and from professor Barry B. Powell's reading of the first 100 lines <a href="https://soundcloud.com/oupacademic/iliad-in-greek-first-100-lines">of the Iliad</a> and <a href="https://soundcloud.com/oupacademic/the-odyssey-book-1-lines-1-105-in-ancient-greek">of The Odyssey</a> (licensed under a CC-BY-NC-SA 3.0 licence).
